 MPW8 : ARBITER PUF
 
Arbiter PUFs. utilize the intrinsic timing differences of two symmetrically designed paths to a. single bit of the response at the output of the circuit 

Arbiter-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is one kind of the delay-based PUFs that use the time difference of two delay-line signals. 

In cryptography and within embedded security ICs, the PUF is used to create keys that are generated on-demand and instantaneously erased once used. PUF is dependent on random physical factors (unpredictable and uncontrollable) that exist natively and/or are incidentally introduced during a manufacturing process.
