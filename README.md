|-----------------------------------------|

Arbiter-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is one kind of the delay-based PUFs that use the time difference of two delay-line signals.

The arbiter PUF, shown in Figure comprises two identically laid out paths. To measure a response bit from the arbiter, a rising edge is input simultaneously to the two paths. This input signal races through the circuit, and a latch at the output detects which path propagated the input signal faster.


This project have taught me  a lot about pdks, Openlane flow , RTL2GDS flow and many more.

Looking forward for more such collaborations and projects.
